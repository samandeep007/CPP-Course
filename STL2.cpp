	STL comprises of four components:
	Iterators: Loop through over --> Like vectors --> ints are loosely iterators 
	Functors: Manage state --> Parameterized --> Overloading of parenthesis --> State in past and present
	Algorithms: Search, Sort libraries --> No need to implement them from scratch
	Container: implementation of some well defined data structures
			   --> Sequence Types: Vectors, list, deques, stacks, queues
			   --> Associative Types: Sets, multisets, maps(two tuples --> key, value pair), multimaps(binary trees)
			   --> Unordered Associative Types: Sets, multisets, maps, multimaps(hash maps)
